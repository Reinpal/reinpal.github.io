Photography plays a big role in my life. Be it analog or digital there’s something about capturing the essence of a moment that really interests me. So it was quite obvious when friend and fellow-photographer Simon Möstl contacted me if I wanted to work with him on a new project. 

## A new concept

Simon and another long time friend of mine Alexander Rauch came up with the innovative Idea to offer an on-location photography service. The two work together as a young and talented photography duo. The idea is to be as flexible as possible with their equipment so they can be location independent and therefore can cater their clients needs better. Some of their core services are Fashion and Beauty Photography as well as Business and Company Portraits. 

## The Design Approach

My part was to give live to their idea and bring the identity to life. After the first meeting it was pretty clear in which direction the two wanted to go. Due to the amazing quality of their work we tried incorporate that into the Logo. More often than not a photographers logo comes short of the quality he or she has to offer. 

The first few Ideas where based on creating a distinct visual Identity with strong typefaces to show their unique approach of a photography collective. 

After a few more iterations we agreed on the final logo mark. 

At Onloph I chose a Didone typeface to represent the high quality in their fashion photography. As we all recognize those didone fonts from fashion magazines we are able to bring the logo into the right context. Complimentary to the Typeface used in the Logo we chose Brandon Grotesque Bold as the secondary Typeface. It’s used in the print products of the two, mainly for headlines and Brandon Text is used for body copy. 

For the colors I decided to remain with black and white, so that the Logo doesn’t distract from their work, but rather comes into  view when you really want so see it. 

## Stationary Design

For their print products I used the above mentioned typefaces to create a minimal but appealing style. The business cards only contain the most important contact information to remain as uncluttered as possible. The cards were printed at the Infinitive Factory in Graz. They make awesome letterpress prints on their old heidelberg printing machines. This adds a lot of value to the cards because it stands out from most of the other business cards out there. Be sure to check out their work.

The letterhead is based on the well known Marber Grid. Slightly modified for use on A4 sized paper. The columns combined with the type clearly show the hierarchy on the page and guarantee legibility and readability. The focus und the clean and minimal design is kept to the last detail in the invoice table. 

Summing up you can say that ONLOPH is tied closely to their visual design as it really compliments their work and their photography. The minimal black and white design puts a strong emphasis on the photographs and focuses straight on the most important content on their print products.
