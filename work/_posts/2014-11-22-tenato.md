In mid 2013 one of my closest friends and fellow design nerd Lukas Kollmann got contacted to be part of a start-up as a designer and work on the branding and corporate identity. After a few phone calls it was quite clear that he couldn’t do all the heavy lifting on his own and put me into the boat. At the kick-off meeting the founders proposed the idea to us and what the needed from us. It’s about a Webapp for creating schedules for your staff. Where the staff and the team members could actively take part in the creation of the schedule via connecting with the App and making wishes wether they want to work a shift on a certain day. Basically the schedule should build itself and cut off a lot of time that goes into coordinating wishes from dozens of team members. 

The name of the app was teamghost but the founders found that the name needed to be reworked. So our first meetings were name finding meetings and also to find a concept on which we could build our design up upon. The name that resulted out of the meetings was: tenato. Abbreviation for team-navigation-tool.

# Our design approach

Connectivity was one of the key words. And we tried to reflect that with the Logo Design. As you can see from the evolution of the logo that there are three nodes which are connected together. Through the iterations you can see that in the end all nodes are connected. Basically representing the core functionality of the Webapp which is to connect with team members and help create a schedule for the whole team.

The next steps were Color and Typography. We needed something modern and flexible. So we chose the wonderful Brandon Grotesque by Hannes von Döhren. Set in italic to also show some dynamics in the logo. 

For the colors we picked neutral greys combined with a tourquoise signal color as our main color.  

While working on the Corporate Design we quickly realized that the current look of the App and the Marketing Page also were desperately in need of an overhaul. So we suggested to also take on a redesign on the digital side. Nowadays print and digital go hand in hand and especially as a new start-up in the business-sector you can’t afford to have an unstable design system. 

So we took the challenge and started with some research. We focused down to major competitors internationally and found no direct competitors in Austria. That gave us a lot of breathing room for design decisions as there were basically no preconceptions of how a scheduling interface should look like. From this competitor analysis we took a lot of valuable data for  a long-term strategy for feature implementation and development of the app as well as a general overview of the market. After that we started reworking the current state of the UI of the App. Coincidentally we also had a User-Interface-Design Course at FH Joanneum so we proposed to make the product our exercise for this course. Our professor Mr. Konrad Baumann was happy that we could unite a real world project together with university and he offered help in the initial research and testing phase. 

We had a meeting with him and the founder of tenato Jürgen Math.   Mr. Baumann immediately saw the potential of the service and pointed out some flaws in the App. Even tough it was an informal meeting we already had some valuable Data concerning the usability of the product.

We designed a first prototype that should be implemented quickly and another one that should act as tenato v2.0. Both prototypes focused on our first experiences with the app and the flaws we discovered. Most of them were structure based and caused the flow to be unnecessarily slow. We improved the UX by removing some unneeded hierarchical elements and made the scheduling process a lot quicker. But as it turned out we all had to refresh our batteries and take a new spin on the whole product. Sometimes it’s better not to rush to a decision but to take your time. So after a summer break we met up together to discuss the future of the app. Not only are we going to offer the app on the desktop but also ship a mobile optimized version. Which is great because it adds to the connectivity and the flexibility and we both get a chance to design another UI system. Yay! =)

Luckily we could finally conduct some real world usability tests with prospective  clients. The tests were done with the current version of the app before our first redesign iteration to see if there are any fundamental flaws we haven’t spotted yet. And indeed we found some very valuable data especially concerning the flexibility of the app wether if the team is in the gastronomy or service industry. 

Currently we are building an inventory of Interface Elements to be used on both the desktop and the mobile version as well as rethinking the structure of the app.

We evaluated the results and are right now working on the next iteration of the tenato interface. So be sure to check back for some updates of the project.
