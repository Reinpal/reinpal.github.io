At FH-Joanneum one of the main objectives during the 4th semester is to found a „virtual“ Design-Agency. To do so we gathered up in small groups and began to think about the rough direction in which we wanted to head.

The initial team-building session went pretty quickly as we all pretty much already knew with whom we wanted to work with. Our team consisted of 6 people, namely Barbara Gundl, Jakob Listabarth, Lukas Kollmann, Thomas Mirnig, Felix Pichler (Make sure to check out their portfolios too!) and myself. Our skill-set was set up pretty broadly so we decided to focus on Corporate- and Webdesign. We all knew where our strengths were, so it was kind of a no-brainer who was responsible for what.

## First things first

Within the first few weeks we had to plan the strategy and other business related things e.g finding a target group, financial planning and of course the Corporate Identity of our company. These decision acted as a solid base for the future projects we wanted to tackle.
 
Given that we are a homogeneous bunch of creative and fun people, we wanted to reflect that into our identity. We came up with the name „Wundertüte“ which is German for „jamboree bag“ or „grab bag“. 

>You never know what you’re gonna get, but you’ll love it.

The key characteristics of a Wundertüte which we applied to our own Corporate Identity. Individual solutions and concepts for every client was our premise. Combined with our mission statement „We make Ideas visible“, we made sure that our clients will get what they want, even if they didn’t exactly knew what they were looking for.

So there we were, Wundertüte, a collective of young and aspiring designers just waiting to get our hands on everything related to Branding in combination with Webdesign and Development.

## Establishing a design system

Next step was to come up with a Corporate Design. So we all started to think of different combinations of colors and typography that would reflect the core values of our brand. After a few design iterations based on feedback from all of our Professors at the University we found the perfect Identity for us as a company. 

## The Logo

My personal take on the Logo was to create a strong mark which would work on it’s on. I’ve decided to use a slightly modified version of Brandon Grotesque Bold. It’s modern character and the small x-height really helped creating a distinguished logomark. It acts as a contrast to our fun and playful nature by not showing what we’re all about at first sight. Just how a Wundertüte works in real life.

## The colors

We chose two shades of blue for our main colors. Appropriately named Wunderblau and Wunderhellblau. Blue was our choice because it stands, again contrasting to our playful nature, for calmness but also for trust and friendship and the slight turquoise tint represents communication. The Wunderblau is used as our main color whereas the Wunderhellblau acts as an accent-color.

We also developed a striped pattern to serve as a background for some of our stationary e.g. Business Cards and Letterhead.

Confetti has been chosen to accompany our fun nature and to loosen up the contrasts created by the clean type and the calm colors.

## The Website

After we’ve all settled on our Corporate Design it was that much easier to put together a Corporate Website according to our own Design-Manual. My Job was to design and develop the Website with the help of Felix and Thomas (the three of us formed the infamous Team-Web of Wundertüte).

We used Wordpress as a Content Management System and decided to build a responsive and retina-ready Site. The use of large images and minimal typography are setting focus on the content and by putting everything onto one page we eliminated the need for unnecessary hierarchical elements. You can see the site live right here. 

## The Project

The biggest project on which we worked during the semester was a website for the creative coworking-space Sechserhaus in Graz. You can see the Website live right here and read a more detailed case study about the creation of it right here.

## Summing up

<— Need some work —!>
Working together with a bunch of creative people from different fields definitely helped me gain invaluable experience concerning working in an interdisciplinary design team. We could all share our expertise and learn from each other. That overlap of our mixed skills made it possible to let go of old-fashioned design workflows and establish a more modern and fresh approach to Corporate and Webdesign. This not also meant that we could build better products but also helped me gain a lot of insight of how to work as a small and flexible team in the design industry.
