One of the main objectives of the 4th Semester at FH Joanneum is to start a „virtual“ Design-Agency. The initial team-building session went pretty quick as we all pretty much already knew with whom we wanted to work with. Our team consisted of 6 people, namely Barbara Gundl, Jakob Listabarth, Lukas Kollmann, Thomas Mirnig, Felix Pichler and myself. Concerning our skill-set we were set up pretty broadly. We all knew where our strengths were, so it was kind of a no-brainer who was responsible for what. Make sure to check out their portfolios too!

## Starting off

Within the first few weeks we had to agree on the direction in which we wanted to go. I’m not only talking about the name but also finding a target group, financial planing and of course the Corporate Identity of our company. 
During the first brainstorming session it was clear pretty quickly, that we are a homogenous bunch of creative and fun people. So we wanted to reflect that into our Corporate Identity. Being funny and ironic was our main business goal and we came up with the name „Wundertüte“ which is German for „Wonderbag“ (amazing translation, need to look it up). 

So there we were, Wundertüte, a collective of young and aspiring designers just waiting to get our hands on everything related to Branding in combination with Webdesign and Development. You’ll never know what you’re gonna get, but you’ll like it. This was probably our key claim. And our mission statement was: „We make ideas visible“. 

>We celebrate Ideas.
>We celebrate beautiful things.
>We celebrate the moment.

Our key target group are people with big dreams and plans because we all are hungry for a challenge. Having settled all the details of how we wanted to be as a company we went straight into the design phase.

## Developing a Corporate Identity

So we all started to think of Colors, Type and Logo Ideas that would reflect the core values of our brand. After a few sessions with feedback from all of our Professors at the University we found the perfect Identity for us as a company. 

## The Logo

My personal take on the Logo, was to create a strong word mark which would work on it’s on. It’s basically a slightly modified version of Brandon Grotesque Bold. Which shines with its modern character and the small x-height creating a distinguished logomark. It works as a contrast to our fun and playful nature by not showing what its all about at first sight. Kind of how a Wundertüte works in real life. 

## The colors

We chose two shades of blue for our main colors. The Wunderblau and the Wunderhellblau. Blue stands, again contrasting to our playful nature, for calmness, Trust and Friendship and the slight turquoise hue stands for communication. The Wunderhellblau is used as a accent-color.

We also developed a striped pattern to serve as a background for some of our stationary e.g. Business Cards and Letterhead. 

Another key element of our Corporate Identity are confettis. Which accompany our fun nature and contrasts with the clean type and the clam colors. 

## The Website

After we’ve all settled on our Corporate Design it was that much easier to put together a Corporate Website according to our Design-Manual. My Job was to design and develop the Website. We used Wordpress as our CMS and decided on making the Website responsive and retina-ready. Large-Images and minimal typography  are used to put a focus on the content. You can see the site right here. 

## The Project

The biggest project during the semester on which we worked as a company was a website for the creative-coworking space Sechserhaus in Graz. You can see the Website live right here and read a more detailed case study about the creation of it right here. 

## Summing up

It was definitely a worth-wile experience working with a bunch of creative people from different fields together. We could all share our expertise and form the best possibly product. All of us played a substantial role within the team and that’s what made our virtual company a success.
