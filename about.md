Hello! My name is Stefan Reinprecht and I am an interdisciplinary designer from Graz, Austria. I am really enthusiastic about web designing and filmmaking.  

### My Story

My first encounter with designing was when I started skateboarding as a teenager. I was responsible for making logos for our crew as well as filming and editing the clips. The equipment we had was poor and our tricks were nothing better but this was the time where my passion for the moving image was created. Since then I almost always had held a camera in my hands. 

Web design and Development came into my life when I started business school (Handelsakademie) with the main focus on information management and information technology in 2009. 

In 2012 I started studying Information Design at University of Applied Sciences (FH Joanneum) in Graz. There I did not only have the opportunity to hone my own skills with moving images and code, but also to immerse myself in other fields of design, which was essential to round off my skillset as a web-designer. This brought me valuable experiences from various fields of design and aroused my interest in working with modern, interdisciplinary teams. 

Nowadays technology is moving at an unparalleled pace, which makes it more necessary than ever to have an appropriate web appearance. As it is my passion and profession I want to help companies to achieve that.
