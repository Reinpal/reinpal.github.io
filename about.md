Hello! My name is Stefan Reinprecht and I’m an interdisciplinary  designer from Graz, Austria and if you love filmmaking or webdesign, I want to work with you. 

### My story

The first time I set foot into the design-field was when I started skateboarding as a teenager. We made logos for our crew and back then crappily filmed our crapy tricks, you gotta start somewhere I guess. The experiences I’ve made while filming is where my love for the moving image comes from. Since then pretty much always held a camera in my hands. 

Webdesign and Development came into my life in 2009 during Business School with Information Technology. With technology moving at an unparralelled pace, there's more need than ever to have an appropriate web appearance. And I want to help companies to achieve that.

### My goals

In 2012 I started studying Information Design at FH Joanneum in Graz. Where I not only have the opportunity to sharpen my skills with moving images and code, but also to dive into other fields of design to round of my skillset as a designer. 

These valuable experiences from various design fields have broadened my skill-set and that's why I'm interested in working with modern, interdisciplinary teams. I'm currently looking for an internship, so if you like what you see, please send me an E-Mail.
