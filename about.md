Hello! My name is Stefan Reinprecht and I am an interdisciplinary designer from Graz, Austria. I am really enthusiastic about webdesign and filmmaking.

### My Story

My first encounter with design was when I started skateboarding as a teenager. I happened to be responsible for making logos for our crew as well as filming and editing the clips. The equipment we had was poor and our tricks were nothing better but this was the time where my passion for the moving image was created. Since then I almost always had held a camera in my hands.

Web design and Development came into my life when I started business school (Handelsakademie) with the main focus on information management and information technology in 2009.

In 2012 I started studying Information Design at University of Applied Sciences (FH Joanneum) in Graz. There, I did not only have the opportunity to hone my own skills with moving images and code, but also to immerse myself in other fields of design, which was essential to round off my skillset as a designer. This brought me valuable experiences from various fields of design and aroused my interest in working with modern, interdisciplinary teams.

In 2015 I was a Front-End Development Intern at En Garde, a cross-media design agency, based in Graz. Not only could I improve my development workflow a lot but I also gained a lot of experience in working with multidisciplinary teams. Theory put to practice. Now that I have studied Information Design, worked for an agency and beeing a Freelance–Designer, I have made the decision to apply for a Masters Degree in Media Design at FH Joanneum as the next stepping stone in my career as a designer.
